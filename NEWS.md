# v0.1.3

* Added a `NEWS.md` file to track changes to the package.
* Recognise abbreviations of 'Federal Capital Territory' i.e. FCT.
* Disable error-check on character type for `is_state` so it can be used more effectively for functional programming constructs.

# v0.1.4

* Suppress deprecation warning for `is_state()` when it is called internally by package function; displayed only when function is called directly.
