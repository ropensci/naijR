The goal of **naijR** is to make it easier for R users to work with data related to Nigeria.

## Usage
### Some simple operations
#### Maps
A key feature of this package is its capabilities in drawing local geospatial maps. Currently, only vector-type graphics are supported. To find out more, read the vignette--accessible from within R with

```{r vignette, eval=FALSE}
vignette('nigeria-maps', 'naijR')
```

#### States
To create a list of all the States of the Nigerian Federation, simply call `states()`.

```{r, results='hold'}
library(naijR, quietly = TRUE)
ss <- states()
head(ss)
cat(sprintf("\n...but Nigeria has %i States.", length(ss)))
```

States from a given geo-political zone can also be selected:

```{r}
states(gpz = "ne")  # i.e. North-East
```

For other capabilities of this function, see `?states()`.

#### Local Government Areas
This is a basic example that shows how to very quickly fetch the names of Local Government Areas within a given State:

```{r example}
lgas("Imo")
```

To list all the LGAs in Nigeria, call the same function without any parameters:

```{r}
n <- length(lgas())
sprintf("Nigeria has a total of %i Local Government Areas", n)
```

Want to create a function to check how many LGAs a particular State has?

```{r}
how_many_lgas <- function(state) {
  n <- length(lgas(state))
  cat(state, "State has", n, "LGAs\n")
}

how_many_lgas("Sokoto")
how_many_lgas("Ekiti")
```

#### Working with phone numbers
It is common to come across datasets where phone numbers are wrongly entered or misinterpreted by software like MS Excel. The function `fix_mobile()` helps with this.

```{r mobile}
fix_mobile("8032000000")
```

The function works on vectors; thus an entire column of a table with phone numbers can be quickly processed. Illegible or irreparable numbers are turned into missing values, e.g.

```{r mobile_vectorized_1}
(dat <- data.frame(
  serialno = 1:8,
  phone = c(
    "123456789",
    "0123456789",
    "8000000001",
    "9012345678",
    "07098765432",
    "08123456789",
    "09064321987",
    "O8055577889"
  )
))
```

```{r mobile_vectorized_2}
fix_mobile(dat$phone)
```


## Installation
To download and install the current stable version of this package from CRAN:

```{r cran-install, eval=FALSE}
install.packages("naijR")
```

The development version can be obtained from [GitHub](https://github.com/BroVic/naijR) with:

``` {r install, eval = FALSE}
# If necessary, 'install.packages("remotes")' first
remotes::install_github("BroVic/naijR")
```
